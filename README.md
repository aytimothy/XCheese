# XCheese

Quick and dirty way to call `StageUpdate.ShowStageRewardUI()` to cheese and automatically clear any stage by pressing F5.  
(For XDiVE offline version)

This is moreorless a "Hello World" I wrote.

## Known Bugs

* Hard lock if you try to show the reward UI before the stage has begun (the "Ready, Go!" sequence has finished playing).
 
Won't be bothered fixing any of them; wait for @darkhunter_'s release on the Discord.
